// lead who is not a people-app lead saw no Reports entry while the page worked
// by URL, and a people-app lead who is not a leave lead saw the entry and

// The source enforces this at the ROUTE, building its router from a role table
// so an ineligible user gets a 404 (route.ts:129-149, AppHandler.tsx:46). We do

// route, from this one mapping — so the menu, the tab bar and the screen cannot
// disagree, and a tab that is hidden cannot be reached by typing its URL.
