/**
 * The source's own words, character for character.
 *
 * This is the test the port never had. Every one of these had been rewritten
 * or dropped — "Transaction updated" for "Successfully saved the edited
 * transaction", counts spliced into two others, three missing entirely — and
 * because nothing asserted any string, an audit that fixed ten real defects
 * still left the wording as it was. A behavioural test cannot catch a rename;
 * only this can.
 *
 * From `SnackMessage.success` in the source's config/constant.ts. If the source
 * changes, this file changes with it — deliberately, and in one place.
