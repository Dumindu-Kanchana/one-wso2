/**
 * What the card-expense screens say when something succeeds.
 *
 * Verbatim from the source's `SnackMessage.success` (config/constant.ts). The
 * port had rewritten four of these and dropped three, which is how the same
 * action came to be announced differently in the two apps — "Transaction
 * updated" here against "Successfully saved the edited transaction" there.
 *
 * Errors are deliberately not listed. The source pairs each failure with a
 * fixed "Unable to …" line; this port surfaces the cause through
 * `describeError` instead, which is the choice the leave port already made
 * (`leaveCopy.ts:78-85` keeps its error strings but the screens do not use
 * them). One convention across the ported apps beats matching this one.
 *
 * Pinned character-for-character by ccCopy.test.ts — this wording is what
 * drifted, and nothing held it.
