// editor. No request, no spinner, no re-render of the world. The server is involved
// exactly twice: once to ask the model about values our own rules could not resolve,

//
// Validation is recomputed from the rows on every change, which is cheap (string
// comparison over a few hundred rows) and means a stale "all clear" can never survive
// an edit that broke something.
