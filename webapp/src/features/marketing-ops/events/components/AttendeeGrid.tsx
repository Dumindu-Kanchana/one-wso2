// The attendee grid — a plain table, deliberately.
//
// This replaced react-datasheet-grid, which was the wrong tool. That library owns the
// cell: its own focus model, virtualized rows, columns as memoized descriptors. Everything
// custom fought it — the accept button died between mousedown and mouseup because a fresh
// component identity remounted the cell; header counts froze because React skips
// re-rendering a memoized element, and the frozen one held a stale handler that reverted
// other edits; dropdowns had to be un-portalled to survive the focus model, which trapped
// them in the grid's scroll context; and its viewport maths put the last row under the
// horizontal scrollbar.
//
// It was chosen when RMMs were going to TYPE their lists in, so Excel paste and drag-fill
// were headline requirements. Drafting now happens in Google Sheets and this screen
// corrects a handful of flagged cells across a few hundred rows. A spreadsheet engine buys
// nothing here and costs a great deal.
//
// So: ordinary DOM, ordinary React, ordinary MUI. Dropdowns portal normally and take the
// app's theme. One cell edits at a time. Keyboard movement is a few lines, not a subsystem.
//
// No virtualization: an event list is hundreds of rows, not millions. If one ever arrives
// with several thousand, render windowing goes HERE — not another library.
