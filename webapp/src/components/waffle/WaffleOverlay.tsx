// is a place you glance at, so the page behind it stays scrollable and

// would give focus containment and hide the background from assistive tech for
// free, and this gives up both. What replaces them:
//
//  - Escape closes, and a click outside closes (ClickAwayListener).
//  - Focus moves into the panel on open and returns to the button on close.
//  - Tab is free to leave the panel, which is correct here — trapping focus in
//    a surface the user can click straight past would strand them.
//  - `role="dialog"` WITHOUT `aria-modal`. Claiming aria-modal on a non-modal
//    surface tells a screen reader the rest of the page is inert when it isn't.
